About jASH
==================================================

jASH is a Julia-based computational chemistry and QM/MM environment, primarily for molecular calculations in the gas phase,
explicit solution, crystal or protein environment. Can do single-point calculations, geometry optimizations, molecular dynamics (soon), numerical frequencies using a MM, QM or QM/MM Hamiltonian.

It is a Julia rewrite of ASH, a Python-based code.

Requirements:

    - Julia installation (>1.5 recommended)
    - Python 3 (for support of legacy code and interfaces to Python libraries).
    - geomeTRIC (optimizer). Python library, easily installed via pip.
